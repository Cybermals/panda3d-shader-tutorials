# Lesson 5: Reflection and Refraction

In this lesson, I will show you how to add reflection and refraction to our water plane. In order to do this, we will need to render the scene to 2 textures. Let's start by discussing how this will work. When looking at the water, objects below the water will get refracted on the surface of the water:
